## 📋 Overview
**Glorica Battle** is a unique card strategy game set in a world where humanity has mastered quantum computing and learned to interact with alternative realities. Players take on the role of "Quantum Guardians" who maintain reality stability using special NFT cards with quantum codes.

In the near future, humanity masters quantum computing, gaining unprecedented ability to manipulate reality. However, a failed quantum experiment causes fundamental changes in human history, triggering a massive manifestation of the Mandela Effect — discrepancies between people's memories and current reality.

A mysterious organization (possibly of extraterrestrial origin) deliberately manipulates the quantum computer to change reality for their own purposes. Each manipulation creates dangerous paradoxes that threaten the very fabric of existence.
