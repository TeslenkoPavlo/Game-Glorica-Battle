## **1. PROJECT NEEDS**.

The iterative approach to the development process (characteristic of MSF) requires the use of a flexible way of maintaining documentation - *living documents* should change during the evolution of the project. This approach differs significantly from the principles of the cascade model documentation, where the development process begins only after all requirements and specifications are ready and recorded.

MSF project documentation, like their program code, is created iteratively. During the *conceptualization (analysis) phase*, plans take the form of high-level descriptions of *approaches* and are circulated to project team members and other stakeholders for feedback. 

For example, a test approach may be briefly formulated during the analysis phase and transformed into a test plan in later phases. After moving to the *planning phase*, the documents are gradually finalized, detailed plans are created and submitted to all stakeholders for review, and the process described above is repeated iteratively. The types of plans and the total number of documents describing them may vary from project to project

### **1.2. Project vision**

*A vision is an open-ended idea of what a solution should look like. The project vision is aimed at creating a common understanding of the project concept by all parties involved. 

The vision statement should be short enough to be memorable, clear enough to be understood, and strong enough to motivate. A good vision statement meets the five SMART characteristics:

- **Specific** - the vision clearly indicates the (ideal) state that the project aims to achieve
- **Measurable** - provides the project team with a clear criterion for the success of the project and the achievement of its goals
- **Achievable** - the goals set out in the vision should be achievable within the available resources, time, and capabilities of the team. Achievability motivates the team to complete the project
- **Relevant** - the goals set out in the vision should be of significant importance to stakeholders and directly related to their problems and/or needs
- **Time-based** - the vision should clearly indicate the expected timeframe in which the solution will be created

Glorica Battle is an innovative NFT card strategy in the world of quantum technologies for players seeking unique gameplay and influence on the development of the plot. The project solves the problem of monotony of existing NFT games through quantum mechanics and an affordable economic model.

## **2. SOLUTION CONCEPT**

*The solution concept* provides a general description of the approaches that the project team plans to use to solve problems and/or meet stakeholder requirements.

### **2.1 Goals and Objectives**
The development of the solution concept begins with the project team's identification, description, and documentation of the project objectives. Each goal is then broken down into measurable components - *tasks*.

The main goals of the **Glorica Battle** project are aimed at creating an innovative NFT card game that combines quantum technologies with dynamic gameplay and strategic depth:
>- **providing a unique gaming experience for players**
>    - implementing quantum mechanics that change the rules of the game in real time
>    - implementing multiple storylines with the ability to influence events
>    - creating dynamic battlefields that change depending on the player's actions
>    - providing visual and thematic depth to engage the player in the game world
>- **ensuring long-term player engagement**
>    - implementing a system of NFT cards for collecting
>    - creating a deep card strategy with the ability to build individual decks
>    - regular content updates (cards, events, story chapters)
>    - implementing a system of achievements, rewards and competitions between players
>- **creating a transparent and scalable economic model**
>    - implementing a clear and understandable monetization system
>    - implementing in-game market for trading cards
>    - support for investment from players and external participants
>    - creation of financial analytics and reporting for investors

>    - use of modern data protection tools and NFT assets
>    - development of a game based on a modular architecture with the possibility of expanding functionality
>    - ensuring stable operation of the system as the number of users grows

### **2.2. Assumptions and Limitations**
In the course of forming the solution concept for the Glorica Battle project, a number of assumptions were identified related to the expected functionality of the game, as well as limitations arising from both the technical and business environment in which the product will be implemented.

>- **Basic *assumptions***
>    - players will have basic knowledge of NFTs and crypto wallets, or will go through interactive tutorials built into the game
>    - players will be willing to interact with in-game microtransactions if fair gameplay value is provided
>    - the basic architecture of the game will allow the project to scale without a complete redesign of the backend or client side
>    - the game will have the ability to create groups of players to compete as a team
>    - most players will have access to a stable internet connection to participate in PvP modes and synchronize data
>    - the ability to temporarily rent NFTs (e.g. for beginners)
>- ***Limitations* to consider:**
>    - all NFT assets must be stored on an open-source blockchain
>    - game functionality must be available in at least English and Ukrainian at launch
>    - player and investor interactions must be secured in accordance with GDPR and Web3 security standards
>    - all NFT transactions must be approved by the user - automatic write-offs are prohibited
>    - all graphics and sound must be copyrighted or licensed to avoid legal risks


### **2.3 Usage Analysis**
The basis of requirements formulation is the use case analysis, which includes the definition of *users* and a description of how users will *interact* with the solution.

#### USERS

Many parties are interested in developing a solution, but it is the users who will work directly with it, so before you start designing a solution, you need to determine who will interact with it.

The analysis process should identify *user groups* (for example, based on the areas of their activities in which the solution to be developed will be used).

>- **The following user groups can participate in the gameplay:**
>    - Players (game users) are the main target audience. They receive, collect, exchange and use NFT items during the game.
>    - Game developers - responsible for technical support, functionality updates and story development
>    - Partner services - wallets, dashboards, API analytics, etc., which provide tools for integration, monitoring or asset managemen

#### USE CASES

*Use cases define the sequences of actions that users perform when interacting with a solution. MSF does not force the use of specific ways to describe use cases, but it does recommend using the UML language (*precedent diagram*) as one of the possible and quite common options.

### **2.4. Requirements**
Requirements define what the solution you are developing should do (what services should be provided to users). Requirements can be described in terms of *functionality* or in the form of rules and parameters that define functionality.

#### USER REQUIREMENTS

>- **The main requirements for the functionality of the NFT solution for the game Glorica Battle include the following:**
>    - creation and display of NFT items in the game's gameplay interface
>    - the ability to view, sort and filter NFTs in the player's internal inventory
>    - support for multiple use of NFTs in different game modes
>    - execution of NFT purchase and sale transactions through external marketplaces (e.g. OpenSea)
>    - exchange of NFTs between players via the p2p trade function
>    - verification of the NFT wallet (e.g. via MetaMask or WalletConnect) for entering the game
>    - protection against duplicate tokens and fraudulent transactions
>    - viewing the user's transaction history
>    - integration of NFT progress with the player's account in the leaderboard system

#### СИСТЕМНІ ВИМОГИ

>- **System requirements for the solution include:**
>    - use of a blockchain with support for smart contracts (Ethereum, Polygon or Solana)
>    - compatibility with popular Web3 wallets (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet)
>    - the backend of the solution must be deployed in a cloud environment
>    - constant backup of player data and NFT state
>    - use of IPFS or other decentralized storage to store NFT metadata


### **2.5. Scope**
The scope defines the *parameters* of the solution to be created, detailing the functionality, defining what will be left out of the solution and specifying the *criteria* by which stakeholders will judge the readiness of the solution. The framework is created on the basis of a *unified vision*, is the result of a *compromise between the formulated goals and the conditions of reality* and reflects the customer's *prioritization of existing requirements* for the solution being created. Part of the process of defining the project scope is to move less important functionality from the current project to future plans.

*The solution scope defines the solution's *functionality* and capabilities (including those that are not software-related). A feature (functionality, component, *feature*) is a required or desired aspect of software or hardware. 

For example, previewing before printing may be a feature of a word processor; encrypting email messages may be a feature of an email program. User support documents, online help files, operational documentation, and staff training can also be part of the solution.

*The project scope defines the *scope of work* that must be completed by the project team to deliver all the elements defined in the solution framework to the customer.

*Managing the project scope is critical to its success.* MSF suggests defining and capturing the scope of the solution and the project using the *tradeoff triangle* and the project *tradeoff matrix*.

#### SOLUTION FUNCTIONALITY

>- **The main features and functions of the solution include:**
>    - creation of game decks based on NFT cards
>    - storage of NFTs on the blockchain (Ethereum or L2 solution) with unique tokens and metadata
>    - exchange and sale of NFT cards between users via an internal marketplace
>    - connection of Web3 wallets (e.g. MetaMask) for user authentication
>    - detailed user documentation and a basic guide for beginners in Web3

#### WITHIN THE SOLUTION

>- **Given limited resources (time, budget, team), the following options have been left outside the first phase of the project:**
>    - implementation of a mobile application (Android/iOS): will be postponed to a future release due to limitations in development resources
>    - rental/leasing system NFT (temporary rental of characters): requires an additional asset protection module, will be implemented after the launch of the main functionality
>    - creation of clans, tournaments: requires the development of a separate server and synchronization logic

### **2.6. Decision Approval Criteria**

>- **The decision on the readiness of the NFT card game for implementation will be made by stakeholders based on the following criteria:**
>    - all functionality specified in the solution has been implemented, including deck building, duel mechanics, NFT storage, and marketplace
>    - the system correctly integrates with Web3 wallets (e.g., MetaMask) and allows authorized users to interact with NFTs
>    - internal tests show the stability of the gameplay, NFT storage, and transactions on the test network
>    - all basic game scenarios (deck creation, participation in duels, card viewing, card buying/selling) work without failures
>    - the documentation covers both technical aspects (API, deployment, smart contract structure) and user instructions (game guide, glossary, FAQ)
>    - stakeholders confirmed that the implemented functionality meets their expectations and initial requirements

## **3. SOLUTION DESIGN STRATEGIES**
### **3.1. Architectural Design Strategy**

Based on the developed list of capabilities and functions, an *architectural design strategy* is formed, which describes the solution as a whole.

The architectural design strategy defines the *components* of the solution and their *interactions*. A great way to describe the solution at this stage is to use illustrative UML diagrams (for example, **class diagrams**, **component diagrams**, **deployment diagrams**, etc.).

:point_right: Form and describe the overall architectural design of the solution.

:bulb: *To do this, you can create diagrams of the specified types using the service [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/?mode=github) (the link will create a new diagram), name it appropriately (for example, ```Class diagram.drawio```), save to folder```/docs/1.Envisioning``` and **add a link to them in this document**!*

### **3.2. Technology Design Strategy**

Developing a solution requires the use of certain *software products, libraries, frameworks, technologies*.

The technology design strategy describes which technologies and software products have been selected by the project team as a means of implementing the solution.

:point_right: Describe with justification what technological tools will be used in the process of working on the solution.

:bulb: *This could look like this, for example:*
>During the work on the system for accounting of educational hours, the following *software products, libraries, frameworks and technologies will be used*:
>- C# programming language:
>   - ASP.NET Core MVC technology - to create a web interface for the educational part
>   - Xamarin platform - to develop a mobile application for teachers
>   - ASP.NET Core Web API - to develop the server part of the system
> - Bootstrap - to ensure the adaptability of the web interface
>- Microsoft Azure cloud platform:
>   - App Services - for hosting a web application
>   - Function App - for hosting REST services
>   - Cosmos DB - database
>   - Service Bus - push notifications
>   - Storage Account - for storing report data
> - Power BI - for building reports and visualizations
